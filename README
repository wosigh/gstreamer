This repo includes the necessary files to build working Gstreamer framework compatible with the webos-internals Video Recorder application.

Gstreamer-0.10.21 is located at http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/

The patch gstreamer-0.10.21-patch-2, and information about it's release, is located at http://opensource.palm.com 

The patch gstreamer-0.10.21-EOS-on-INT.patch is a backport of functionality implemented in current versions of gstreamer, and thus can also be found at:
	http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/

All code is licensed under LGPL unless otherwise noted.

As of this README date, the only binary necessary to be built for compatible functionality is gst-launch.
